# The Bad Way !!!!

This repo contains a simple tomcat-9 project, showing a JSP made full of bad practices. At least, 14 has been identified. This is just one way to show (among many other ways) how you can write code, but you can NOT write Software.

In order to test this example of "bad things" to be done when making Software, you should:

1. Create a directory for this experiment
2. Clon this repo in that directory
3. Udate the sh files for them to reflect the directory of this experiment
4. Start out dockerized DB
5. Restore the script for that DB
6. Start out dockerized tomcat
7. Test it with: http://your.ip.or.localhost//list.jsp

For his to work, it needs:
1. A machine with docker
2. Git installer in this machie

That's it !!!!
